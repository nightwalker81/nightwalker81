## Hi there 👋
 
### Data Engineer transitioning from Learning & Development | Passionate about AI, NLP & ML Engineering

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
I am a former **Learning & Development Manager (L&D)** with a Master's in HR, now fully transitioning into **Data Engineering and AI**.  
I bring a unique blend of:

- ⭐ Strong communication & stakeholder management  
- ⭐ Deep understanding of business processes & user needs  
- ⭐ Technical expertise in data engineering, automation & AI  

This hybrid background allows me to design **data systems that are powerful AND human-centered**, especially in NLP and RAG applications.

## 🔧 Technical Skills

### 🛠 Data Engineering  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, relational modeling, advanced queries)  
- **NoSQL** (MongoDB)  
- **Data Pipelines & ETL/ELT:** Airbyte, custom pipelines  
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Kestra  
- **Streaming Concepts:** Kafka / Redpanda  
- **Docker** (containerization & deployment basics)  
- **API exposure** for ML & analytics workloads  
- **Cloud architecture modeling** (Project 9)  
- **Testing** with pytest  

### 🤖 AI, Machine Learning & NLP  
- **RAG systems** (FAISS + LangChain + LLMs)  
- **Embeddings & semantic search**  
- **Ollama** + Qwen models  
- **Supervised ML** with scikit-learn  
- **Feature engineering & preprocessing**  
- **Basic MLOps** (evaluation, reproducibility, pipelines)  

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- PostgreSQL  
- MongoDB  
- Airbyte  
- Kestra  
- Redpanda / Kafka fundamentals  
- Docker  
- Poetry (environment & dependency management)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Tableau (data visualization)

## 🎯 What makes my profile unique
I combine **people skills from HR/L&D** with strong **technical engineering skills**:

- I translate business needs into clear technical requirements  
- I communicate effectively with technical & non-technical teams  
- I design solutions that consider **usability, user experience & organizational impact**  
- I manage complex projects with structure, clarity, and empathy  

This makes me particularly effective in roles such as:
- Data Engineer  
- AI / NLP Engineer  
- Analytics Engineer  
- Data Product roles  
- ML Engineering (future goal)
